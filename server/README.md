# Yelp Camp 

A Node. js Web Application

## Demo
> See this app in action at [http://abhagsain-camping.herokuapp.com/](http://abhagsain-camping.herokuapp.com/)

**I've added a demo user Hitman** on the login page, so you don't have to sign up to test the functionality.

## Installation

Make sure you have these things installed
* [Node](https://nodejs.)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center)
  
  * [MLab](https://mongolab.com) (Alternative to downloading MongoDB locally)
see the [docs](https://docs.mlab.com/)


### You can clone or download this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/abhagsain/yelpcamp.git
```

after that run command

``` 
npm install
```
this will install all the necessary packages that you need to run the application. 

>I've used [dot.env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to store the environment variable, So you need to create a **.evn** file once you clone or download the repo.

paste below code into that file

```
# if you're using MLAB replace variable with your MLAB url
DATABASEURL = mongodb://localhost:27017/[your_database_name]
```

* See how to use [Emmet](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/08/07/emmet-2.0) in VSCode. This [CheatSheet](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/) might be helpful.

>Change default shell in VSCode to [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you're using windows and know some Linux commands. Don't know how to do it? [See here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44435697/vscode-change-default-terminal)

I'll be adding features as I learn more.
